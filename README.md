## Forewords

- This Page is meant to display my abilty to clone a code and deploy it in a functional application using the tools learn during the prework study guide introduction to web development.
- This project bridged the gap between the process of merely following a tutorial and figuring out how to use online resources to deploy an application on my own.
- I learned that without constant practice, the skills required to build a webpage can become daunting quick.
