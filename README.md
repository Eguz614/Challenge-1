# Code-Refracting-Services


## Overview

The Refraction of this site was done to debug existing issues and implement feature requested by the customer. The inital code was riddled with repeated codes that could be simplified with the use of Class and Id attributes to content elements and some features were inoperable due to incomplete processes. With some effort, the page is fully operational and written in a way that any future developer can rationalize the code and improve upon it if additional feature are requested to be implemented.

## How to locate

 Enter in the searchbar the following URL : https://eguz614.github.io/Code-Refracting-Services/  would redirect you to the opening page of the website and from there a customer can navigate the different services offered by Horiseon Inc.

## Operation

A client requested feature for this site was to include  hyperlink redirects to the respective section within the page. So by changing the source location of the links on the navbar to designated Id attributed elements, a customer can quickly navigate the page by simply clicking the desired link. The screenshot highlights the search engine opimitization link and displays the destination after the link is clicked. CSS values were consolidated into classes and variables were used so any last minute changes could be made to one line of code instead of scouring the entire style sheet and changing each value individually.
